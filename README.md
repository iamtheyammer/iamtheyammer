## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sam.

I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering student, full-stack developer, and founder of CanvasCBL. I'm also GoGuardian's first Bug Bounty winner!

I'm fluent in quite a few languages, but I especially enjoy TypeScript, React, Go, and C#.

### Some super cool projects

- My [GitHub action for branch-based environment variables](https://github.com/iamtheyammer/branch-env-vars) does just that
- I wrote apps to download entire [Toyota](https://github.com/iamtheyammer/fetch-toyota-service-manuals) and [Ford](https://github.com/iamtheyammer/fetch-ford-service-manuals) service manuals because you can't just PDF them
- [@da-stoi](https://github.com/da-stoi) and I created [@CovaxSF](https://twitter.com/covaxsf) which Tweeted when COVID-19 vaccine appointments opened up
- ðŸ–© I created [CanvasCBL](https://canvascbl.com), a grade calculator for my high school. It's written in React and Redux on the frontend and Go on the backend. [Check out its code!](https://go.canvascbl.com/code)
- [ChromebookGUI](https://github.com/iamtheyammer/gam-cros-win-wrapper) makes it way easier to manage fleets of Chromebooks
- ðŸ¤– I'm working on a modular Discord bot called [Omnibot](http://yammer.me/omnibot)
