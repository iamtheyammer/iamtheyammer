## Hi there 👋 I'm Sam.

I'm a student, full-stack developer, and founder of CanvasCBL. I'm also GoGuardian's first Bug Bounty winner!

I'm fluent in quite a few languages, but I especially enjoy TypeScript, React, Go, and C#.

### Some super cool projects

- 🖩 I created [CanvasCBL](https://canvascbl.com), which was a grade calculator for my school. It's written in React and Redux on the frontend and Go on the backend. [Check out its code!](https://go.canvascbl.com/code)
- 🤖 I'm working on a modular Discord bot called [Omnibot](http://yammer.me/omnibot)
- 📁 I'm also trying to fix Chrome tabs. More info is coming soon!
